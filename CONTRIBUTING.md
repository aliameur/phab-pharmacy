# ðŸ’Ž Contribute to Phab Pharmacy

Contributions to the Phab Pharmacy project are welcomed and appreciated. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, any help is welcome. Here's how you can start contributing:

## Step 1: Choose an Issue

Start by picking an issue to work on. You can choose from existing issues or create a new one if you've identified a bug or a potential enhancement.

- Browse existing issues: [Phab Pharmacy Issues](https://github.com/aliameur/phab-pharmacy/issues)
- Preferably look for issues tagged `help wanted`.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository and Set Up Your Environment

Depending on the type of contribution you're making, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md) to set up your local development environment.

## Step 3: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your work. This keeps your changes organized and separate from the main branch.

Branch names should be descriptive and start with your first name. For example, if you're working on a new feature to add a shopping cart, you can name your branch `ali-shopping-cart`.

## Step 4: Make Your Changes

Make your changes, keeping in mind to follow the coding standards and guidelines of the project. Add or modify tests as necessary.

## Step 5: Commit and Push Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message, explaining what you've done. Then, push your changes to your fork.
- We follow conventional commits, please read more about it [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This will help us standardize our commit messages and make it easier to generate changelogs.
- We do not use a commitizen enforcer, but we would greatly appreciate it if you follow the guidelines ðŸ˜Š.

## Step 6: Create a Pull Request

Go to your branch on GitHub and create a new pull request against the dev Phab Pharmacy branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and reference the issue it addresses (if applicable).

## Step 7: Code Review

Wait for the code review by other members of the team. Be open to feedback and make necessary revisions to your pull request as requested.
- Minimum of 1 approval is required to merge a pull request.

## Stay in Sync with the Main Repository

Keep your fork in sync with the dev repository by regularly pulling from it (or merge often ðŸ˜Š). This helps in avoiding merge conflicts.
